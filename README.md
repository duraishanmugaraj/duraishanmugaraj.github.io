## Customize it to make your own portfolio ✏️

```python
    npm install
  ```
You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

#### -Step 2

You will find `src/portfolio.js` file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
